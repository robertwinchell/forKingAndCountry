basic strategy game using Pygame

Rules:

There are 4 units, King, Warrior, Archer, Wizard, and Scout


Units are created from towns but a friendly unit must be inside or on the town.  Only scouts can take over neutral towns.

Kings inside castles give loyalty bonuses.  Town loyalty decreases the more you recruit from it, if it gets too low you lose control of it.

To win you may either kill the enemy king or take over all the enemy towns.

Units levl up the more they fight and become stronger, except the King, he is powerful enough.

Units move differently depending on their class, which you will see.

To start, just run GameLauncher.py
