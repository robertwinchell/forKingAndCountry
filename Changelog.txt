#1. Starting AI wizard and archer units do nothing, they should patrol with the first warrior

#2. I can't seem to click on the castle it should be clickable to always add or remove the units inside.// should use the right click

#3. When attacking a town it should make a noise and have a unique sound to indicate the town is being attacked

#4. When clicking on a town it should display the loyalty counter.

#5. The AI should create scouts to attempt to take over neutral towns when they are available as well. 

#6. If an AI unit is attacked it should respond by returning the attack.

#7. When a unit is clicked on on the left from the interface the camera should move to them. 

#8. When a turn moves to another player it should focus on their castle.

#9. AI needs more rules to make it more competitive

#10. Unit powers need to be adjusted to balance the game better.

#can we make the scrolling faster

#we should add a button to return to the main menu

#Lets make the archers and wizards do a little more damage against the king, not a lot but enough so it basically isn't nothing.

#Lets make all units movement distance a little bit less, except for archers and scouts, they can stay the same.

#I think the king is too strong, we should give him less hit points.

#The AI doesn't seem to make scouts and try to take over new towns, it should do this as well.

#Could we add medieval style music playing?

#It also seems to display my movement grids during the AIs turn

#I'm not sure if it's set up but hurt units should regain a little lost health each turn.

- units should move around rocks/objects not through them
- can we add a checkbox to toggle the AI animations on/off so if a user doesn't want to they don't have to watch the animations

The animations for AI archers and wizards seem glitchy, do they look fine on your machine or is it a local issue? 

Suggestions for the AI: Is the a way for them to know if they are losing a battle and retreat? For instance I had a warrior, archer and wizard fighting my king but
there's no way they can win but they kept fighting.
